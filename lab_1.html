    A shiny stainless steel sculpture created by Jeff Koons in 1986, inspired by a 
    child’s<br> inflatable toy, 
    sold at Christie’s on Wednesday night for 
    $91.1 million with fees, breaking<br> the record at auction for a
     work by a living artist, set just last November by David Hockney.
    </p>
  

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mnuchin">Robert E. Mnuchin</a>,<br> an art dealer and the father of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, 
  made the winning<br> bid for Mr. Koons’s 1986 “Rabbit” from an aisle seat near the front of the salesroom. 
  He was<br> seated near Peter Brant, the collector and private museum-owner, and Jeffrey Deitch, the dealer.
