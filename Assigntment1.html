            <p> Hey guys! I'm Coleman Hayes, and I'm a rising senior at UNC Chapel Hill! I'm from Lexington, NC<br>
                the home of North Carolina's western-style Barbecue. That's about the only thing that's good in<br>
                Lexington. Anyways, I'm currently studying New Media to further my background in audiovisual   <br>
                production, as well as web development. Hopefully, this site will give you a decent idea of who<br>
                I am as a person, and what my interests are.</p>
